# üçïüçîüç£ Multiclass Food Classification and Size Prediction
This repository contains a Python-based solution for multiclass classification of food images and size prediction (regression) from images.<br>
The project processes food images, extracts relevant features using image processing techniques, applies dimensionality reduction via InfoGain and PCA, and then performs both classification and regression tasks.<br>
## Features<br>
**Image Preprocessing:** <br> Crops, brightens, resizes, and extracts RGB, grayscale, and binary threshold features from images.<br>
**Multiclass Classification:** <br>Identifies the type of food (e.g., pizza, burger, sushi) using a machine learning model.<br>
**Size Prediction:** <br> Predicts the size of the food item (e.g., weight in grams) from the image using regression techniques.<br>
**Dimensionality Reduction:** <br> Reduces the feature space using InfoGain and PCA for efficient and scalable model training.
