üçïüçîüç£ Multiclass Food Classification and Size Prediction
This repository contains a Python-based solution for multiclass classification of food images and size prediction (regression) from images. 
The project processes food images, extracts relevant features using image processing techniques, applies dimensionality reduction via InfoGain and PCA, and then performs both classification and regression tasks.
Features
Image Preprocessing: Crops, brightens, resizes, and extracts RGB, grayscale, and binary threshold features from images.
Multiclass Classification: Identifies the type of food (e.g., pizza, burger, sushi) using a machine learning model.
Size Prediction: Predicts the size of the food item (e.g., weight in grams) from the image using regression techniques.
Dimensionality Reduction: Reduces the feature space using InfoGain and PCA for efficient and scalable model training.
